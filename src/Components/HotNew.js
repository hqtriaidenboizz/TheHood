                            This weekend was filled with buzzy fashion events, from the Balenciaga resort ’23 show at the New York Stock Exchange to the Kardashian-Barker wedding at Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana’s Portofino, Italy pad. But for street style action it was hard to beat the open-to-all Louis Vuitton x Nike “Air Force 1” Exhibition at the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse in Brooklyn.

                            And how do you accessorize for an exhibition dreamed up by the one-and-only Virgil Alboh? With a pair of Nikes, for starters, along with a cool pair of shades and a Vuitton bag. Vogue’s Landon Phillips captured all the best fashion at the show, which is open until May 31 at 73 West Street in the Greenpoint neighborhood.
